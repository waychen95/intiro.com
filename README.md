# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running a React application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js & npm: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, and npm is its package manager. You can download and install them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).
- Git: Git is a version control system. You can download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!
