# Personal Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website built using React. The website showcases my skills, projects, and provides information about me. The project structure includes components for the navbar, home page, and about page.

1. **Navbar:**
   - Update the links and navigation items in `components/Navbar.js` to reflect your own sections and pages.

2. **Home and About Pages:**
   - Modify the content and styling in `pages/Home.js` and `pages/About.js` to personalize your information.

3. **Styling:**
   - Customize the styling of your portfolio by editing the existing styles or adding your own in the `App.css` file.

4. **Projects and Skills:**
   - Create new components or pages to showcase your projects and skills.
